# ViewModel
 
Three fragments have been attached to the MainActivity, which itself has three buttons: RED, GREEN, BLUE. The color change pattern is:

Button : OneFragment : TwoFragment : ThreeFragment
RED : red : green : blue
GREEN : green : blue : red
BLUE : blue : red : green

the first fragment, OneFragment has a button CLEAR, which changes the color of all the three fragments to white, when pressed.
